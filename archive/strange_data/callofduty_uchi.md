Call of Duty Uchi Challenge
===========================

```
  <div>
    <p>It seems like the Legion of Gloom was using Eversec’s infrastructure to host their Call of Duty 2 LAN parties. Seems like the top player was named Ihcbu, always playing on the German team. We can’t seem to get back on the machine to uninstall it. It’s costing us dozens of dollars every month in AWS costs! Please help!</p>
